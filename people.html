Dr. Mohsen Asadnia is a senior lecturer in the Engineering Department, Macquarie University. He received his PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU)-Singapore, and undertook his postdoctoral trainings at Singapore MIT Alliance for research and Technology (SMART) and the University of Western Australia (UWA). His PhD research was focused on development of bio-inspired sensory systems using MEMS techniques. At MIT, he expanded his research interest towards developing artificial inner ear haircell sensors. Dr. Asadnia is currently working on development of novel transistor-based sensor technology for fast, reliable and accurate in situ monitoring of recycled wastewater. In addition, he is also collaborating with multi-disciplinary groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and SMART for development of ultra-sensitive MEMS flow sensors for using in intravenous injections.                </p>

                    Frank Schiliro is a researcher at Macquarie University and  Superintendent at Australia Federal Police. 
                    Frank holds a Master of Research in data science from Macquarie University.
                    Frank's vision is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the policing domain using technology as the enabler. 
                    His research endeavours have been centred around improving the police officer's effectiveness and efficiency in crime response, detection, 
                    prevention and disruption through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).
                    In doing so he draws from 30 years of knowledge and experience in the policing domain as a police officer with the New South Wales Police Force and 
                    Superintendent at the Australian Federal Police. Frank began his career in 1988 with the New South Wales Police Force. He's appointments to positions 
                    have enabled him to develop skills and competencies; in policing, criminal investigation (awarded the designation of Detective), fraud, cybercrime, 
                    computer forensics, information and communications technology, and open innovation.
                    Frank has developed a mobile application framework called ICOPS (Interactive Constable on Patrol System) that will deliver digital transformation to the police officers and 
                    interact with future smart/safe city initiatives.
                    Frank is a certified professional - MACS (Snr) CP with the Australia Computer Society.
